            Preventing tooth decay in children yields numerous advantages,
            including the avoidance of discomfort, stress, and expenses,
            alongside the promotion of good oral habits and overall well-being.
            Preventative measures spare children from the pain and anxiety
            associated with dental procedures such as fillings, offering a less
            invasive and time-efficient alternative.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Moreover, prevention preserves a child&apos;s natural teeth and
            upholds their alignment and bite integrity. By instilling preventive
            practices at home, children acquire valuable oral hygiene and
            dietary habits from an early age, fostering long-term oral and
            overall health while lowering the risk of various dental issues,
            including gum disease.
