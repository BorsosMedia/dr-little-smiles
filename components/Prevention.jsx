        <h2>Prevention Over Treatment</h2>
        <p>Preventing tooth decay in children yields numerous advantages, including the avoidance of discomfort, stress, and expenses, alongside the promotion of good oral habits and overall well-being. Preventative measures spare children from the pain and anxiety associated with dental procedures such as fillings, offering a less invasive and time-efficient alternative.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, prevention can also decelerate the progression of cavities, reducing the necessity for complex treatments and mitigating the stress of dental appointments. In addition, it proves to be cost-effective in comparison to expensive treatments that may not be fully covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>Moreover, prevention preserves a child&apos;s natural teeth and upholds their alignment and bite integrity. By instilling preventive practices at home, children acquire valuable oral hygiene and dietary habits from an early age, fostering long-term oral and overall health while lowering the risk of various dental issues, including gum disease.</p>
