              <span className="bold">Dr. Nikhil (Nik) Sharma</span> is a
              dedicated <span className="bold">Pediatric dentist</span> and a
              dedicated advocate for oral health. His unwavering passion lies in
              the promotion of early oral health practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              His journey into dentistry commenced with a five-year program at
              McGill University. Following this, Dr. Nik embarked on an intense
              one-year residency at the Montreal Children&apos;s Hospital, a
              level one trauma center. It was during this residency that he
              found his calling as a Pediatric dentist. He continued his
              education with a two-year residency in pediatric dentistry at the
              Eastman Institute for Oral Health in Rochester, New York. Upon
              successfully completing his studies and board exams, he returned
              to Montreal as a board-certified pediatric dentist.
            </p>
            <p className="lg:pb-[10vh]">
              In Montreal, Dr. Nik practiced part-time in both a private clinic
              and at McGill as the director of a Hospital Residency program. As
              the program director, he not only trained new dentists in
              providing exemplary pediatric care but also managed numerous
              patients himself in the hospital setting, on the wards and in the
              operating room. Several years later, he transitioned to full-time
              practice as a Pediatric dentist and clinic director in the Greater
              Toronto Area.
